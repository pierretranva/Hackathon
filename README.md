# Hackathon
2022 Fall VT hack
Full-Stack Application using React for frontend, Flask for backend, and Scikit Learn for K-Means Clustering/Data analysis.

We created an application that does CO2 emissions visualization on a map. To determine pollution hotspots we trained a K-Means Clustering model and did custom analysis on the clusters to determine the size of the hotspots of the map. One cirlce shows the CO2 emissions by density and the other shows the total sum of the CO2 emissions.
